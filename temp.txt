1. Wait for Enrollment Activation (1-24 hours)

  - Apple needs to activate your developer account
  - You'll get email confirmation when ready
  - Then you can access App Store Connect

  2. App Store Connect Setup

  Once activated, you'll need to:

  Create App Listing:
  - Go to appstoreconnect.apple.com
  - Create new app with bundle ID: MAHR.Partner.Thaqalayn
  - Fill basic app information

  Configure In-App Purchase:
  - Add in-app purchase product: com.thaqalayn.premium_reciters
  - Set as "Non-Consumable" (one-time purchase)
  - Set price tier (~$2.99)
  - Add name: "Premium Reciters"
  - Add description: "Unlock 5 additional premium Quran reciters"

  3. Testing Options After Setup

  Sandbox Testing (Recommended):
  - Create sandbox test accounts in App Store Connect
  - Test purchases without real money
  - Full purchase flow testing

  Production Testing:
  - Submit app for review (takes 1-7 days)
  - Test with real purchases once approved

  While Waiting for Activation:

  You can still test the complete user signup flow and verify that:
  - New user registration works
  - Bookmarks sync properly
  - Premium status correctly shows "Free Version"
  - Premium reciters show lock icons
  - App functions properly for free users

  The purchase functionality will work once App Store Connect is properly configured with your new developer account.
